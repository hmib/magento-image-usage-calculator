# Magento Image Usage Calculator
Usage calculator to make it possible to purchase images or artwork at various resolutions.

This module is intended to be used with https://github.com/superdav42/magento-image-products and make it possible to setup a magento store like gettyimages.com or istockphoto.com. Once the image products are created the usage calculator lets customers pick a usage for licensing an image to download. Complex usages can be created or it could be used just to let customers choose a resolution for the image they wish to download and the prices can be set accordingly.

**Not ready for production use**
